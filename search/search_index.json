Some alternatives to CountLog exist, but they have weaknesses that prevent some use cases from being satisfied. Thing Counter https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.sleak.thingcounter&hl=en_US Thing Counter allows users to create counters that can be incremented or decremented by the push of a button. This app is helpful for tracking things like gym visits or mice killed . Counters can then be reset and recorded into time ranges, so mice killed could be tracked per month. However, because Thing Counter uses counters as the primary type of data and not events , it has several limitations. Timestamps are not recorded when a counter is modified, so detailed analysis of events over time is impossible (e.g. estimating the statistical distribution of mice killed over time). Metadata about an event cannot be recorded (e.g. \"mouse killed by cat and not by sticky trap\"). Counter modifications are not easily integrated into larger data collection systems (e.g. using Grafana to visualize mice killed over time and then showing it to your landlord). Tallyphant https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.ciarang.tallyphant/ Tallyphant works very similarly to Thing Counter, using counters as its primary type of data. One very nifty feature of Tallyphant is that it allows for logging counter updates to a UDP server using its \"UDP Update\" feature. However, the user interface is janky and the app is not maintained (it's not deployed in the Google Play Store), making it virtually unusable. Loop Habit Tracker https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits&hl=en_US Loop is an open source habit tracker that lets you create habits with their own repetition frequency and reminder schedule. Loop is suitable for ensuring that once-a-day or once-a-week activities are actually performed, such as sweep the apartment or floss your teeth . While Loop can emulate event counters to some degree, its primary use case is for ensuring that daily or weekly tasks are performed, an therefore doesn't allow habits to be performed multiple times per day.","title":"Alternatives"},{"location":"alternatives/#alternatives-to-countlog","text":"CountLog fills a hole in the app ecosystem for manually logged events that can be stored, visualized, and analyzed at any future time.

For installation purposes, this means that you do not need to go to your app store to download the app. To install CountLog, simply visit https://app.countlog.xyz . On mobile, find an \"Add to Home Screen\" option in your browser's menu. On desktop (only works with Chrome), open the menu and click \"Install CountLog\". You can also choose not to install the app, and only use it in the web browser. For this particular app, there would be very little difference in behavior; the benefit for native installation is user convenience.","title":"Installation"},{"location":"installation/#installation","text":"CountLog is a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means that it is built like a website, but runs just like a native app. You can read more about the technical details from Google .

Each one involves tracking events that may be difficult to monitor in any automated way. Low-Frequency Events \ud83d\udc2d Tracking how many mice you have killed in your apartment. If you have a shady or careless landlord, you might have pest problems in your apartment. Every time you kill a fly (or a mouse, in may case >.>) you can increment a counter. You can then analyze the frequency of pests killed in order to hold it over your landlord or forecast future pest problems. \ud83d\ude82 Tracking how many times the train has broken down. Some cities have public transportation systems. Some cities have, well, *cough* SEPTA Regional Rail. If your public transit system causes you to be late for work, you might want to have a personal record of incidents in case you employer starts asking about your lateness. Moderate-Frequency Events \ud83e\uddb7 Tracking the frequency of good behaviors, like how often you floss. Although a habit tracker is nice for tracking how often you clean your teeth, it does have some limitations. What happens if you want to brush you teeth twice per day? What happens if you floss more often than you brush your teeth? With CountLog, you can look at behaviors on a weekly basis and adapt your behaviors for the better. \ud83c\udf5f Tracking the frequency of bad behaviors, like how many times you eat fast food. Maybe you've made a New Year's resolution to not eat out as often. If you use a calorie counting app to track what you eat, that might be a better solution. But if you are targeting a very specific behavior (eat out less), then you might have an easier time tracking it with CountLog. High-Frequency Events \ud83d\udcfa Turning on the TV through a home automation system. Since CountLog supports sending events to an HTTP backend, you can use CountLog as a sort of \"intelligent remote control\" for tracking everyday events. For example, you can hook up CountLog on your phone to become a remote control for you TV, which then allows you to track how often you turn on the TV. \ud83d\udebd Tracking how often you go to the bathroom. Since you can provide text annotations for each event, you can track things like, \"How often do I poop?\" A very good example is given on Imgur . You won't be able to export those figures, but for personal use you could get a lot of similar metrics.","title":"Use Cases"},{"location":"usecases/#use-cases-for-countlog","text":"Listed below are several potential use cases for CountLog.
